# HeightmapGenerator
This application provides several options for creating a black-and-white image that can be used as a heightmap for a random terrain in a videogame.

This project is a sort of an experiment in C# for creating a random heightmap that can be used to generate random terrains in game environments. The idea is that the program will be able to utilize various algorithms to create landscapes with different effects. Currently, the Perlin Noise algorithm works to create a randomized cloud-like texture. I am currently working on the fractal design texture generator for more natural eroded landscapes.
The program can be used for generating heightmaps, and the algorithm can be utilized in procedurally generated game content. To use the program, download the code and run the .exe file inside the bin/Debug folder. I apologize for not naming the project when I started working on it, but as I said it started out as an experiment. After you run the program, you can click on the Perlin button to generate a Perlin noise texture. It might take a second or two. After that, you can save the texture using the button in the middle.
